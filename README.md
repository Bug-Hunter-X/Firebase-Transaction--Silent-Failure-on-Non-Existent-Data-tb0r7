This example demonstrates a common issue when using Firebase transactions: silent failure if the data being updated doesn't exist.  The provided solution ensures a more robust and reliable increment operation.

## Problem:

The `incrementCounter` function uses a Firebase transaction to atomically increment a counter in the database. However, if the `/users/{uid}/counter` path doesn't exist, the transaction silently fails without throwing an error or providing a clear indication of failure. This can lead to hard-to-debug problems.

## Solution:

The solution modifies the transaction function to check for the existence of the counter and initializes it to 0 if it's missing.  This ensures that the increment operation always succeeds, even if the counter is not yet set in the database.
